#README

This is a rails version of the REST API supporting the [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) tutorial from [Christophe Coenraets](https://github.com/ccoenraets). All javascript code is his, and you may check the original repository [here](https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-cellar).

In his posts ([part1](http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-part-1-getting-started/), [part2](http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-%E2%80%94-part-2-crud/) and [part3](http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-%E2%80%94-part-3-deep-linking-and-application-states/)) he presents a [slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) based REST API. I just thought it would be nice to have a rails version.

##Install

The usual steps:

<pre>
$ git clone &lt;repo&gt;
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s
</pre>

I tested this using rails 3.1.3 under ruby 1.9.2. Enjoy.
